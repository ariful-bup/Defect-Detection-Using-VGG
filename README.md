# Image Classification_VGG

The tanning of animal hides and skins produces leather, a sustainable and natural material. Due to the leather's sensitivity to quality and surface flaws, the pricing of the material is arbitrary. Deep learning has recently dominated the sector. Newer models are added to the directory every few years because of ongoing research to improve the image recognition models for deep learning. Deep learning functions by recognizing variations in image sets and extracting details from them. In this paper, with the help of VGG-16 and VGG 19, defects have been detected in leather. These defects may end up leading to various disasters if not taken care of in a timely manner.  In this paper, we are going to introduce an automatic defect detection technique by employing a deep learning method for leather defect detection. As an output, we will show a proposed method for the classification of the leather defect. Balanced Accuracy is between 92.1% and 96.0%.
